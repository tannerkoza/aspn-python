    ### Attributes

    header - TypeHeader:
            Standard ASPN measurement header.

    time_of_validity - TypeTimestamp:
            Time at which the measurement is considered to be valid.

    reference_frame - MeasurementVelocityReferenceFrame:
            Defines measurement reference.

    x - Optional[Optional[float]]:
            Velocity along the first axis of the measurement reference frame enumerated in
            reference_frame.

    y - Optional[Optional[float]]:
            Velocity along the second axis of the measurement reference frame enumerated in
            reference_frame.

    z - Optional[Optional[float]]:
            Velocity along the third axis of the measurement reference frame enumerated in
            reference_frame.

    covariance - NumpyMatrix[float]:
            Measurement error covariance or variance depending on measurement dimension.
            Dimensions of covariance must be num_measÂ²

    error_model - MeasurementVelocityErrorModel:
            Defines an optional error model for other than zero-mean, additive, white Gaussian
            noise (AWGN).

    error_model_params - NumpyArray[float]:
            Error model parameters that characterize the optional error model.

    integrity - List[TypeIntegrity]:
            Measurement integrity. Includes the integrity method used and an integrity value
            (which is to be interpreted based upon the integrity method). The intent of allowing
            num_integrity > 1 is to report multiple integrity values based on multiple integrity
            methods.
