    ### Attributes

    header - TypeHeader:
            Standard ASPN measurement header.

    time_of_validity - TypeTimestamp:
            Time at which the measurement is considered to be valid.

    reference_frame - MeasurementPositionVelocityAttitudeReferenceFrame:
            Defines measurement reference.

    p1 - Optional[Optional[float]]:
            First position term as defined in enum.

    p2 - Optional[Optional[float]]:
            Second position term as defined in enum.

    p3 - Optional[Optional[float]]:
            Third position term as defined in enum.

    v1 - Optional[Optional[float]]:
            Velocity along the first axis of the measurement reference frame enumerated in
            reference_frame.

    v2 - Optional[Optional[float]]:
            Velocity along the second axis of the measurement reference frame enumerated in
            reference_frame.

    v3 - Optional[Optional[float]]:
            Velocity along the third axis of the measurement reference frame enumerated in
            reference_frame.

    quaternion - Optional[Optional[NumpyArray[float]]]:
            Four element quaternion, q = [a, b, c, d], where a = cos(phi/2), b =
            (phi_x/phi)*sin(phi/2), c = (phi_y/phi)*sin(phi/2), and d = (phi_z/phi)*sin(phi/2). In
            this description, the vector [phi_x, phi_y, phi_z] represents the rotation vector that
            describes the frame rotation to be applied to the "reference" frame (ECI, ECEF, or NED)
            to rotate it into the axes that describe the measured attitude, and the value phi is the
            magnitude of the [phi_x, phi_y, phi_z] vector. See "conventions" documentation for more
            detailed information.

    covariance - NumpyMatrix[float]:
            Measurement error variance or covariance depending on measurement dimension. NOTE:
            Attitude errors are expressed as tilt errors, so if an attitude is provided, that should
            count as 3 terms in num_meas. For example, a 3-D position, 3-D velocity, and attitude
            expressed as a quaternion (which takes 10 terms total to describe) is num_meas = 9. A
            second example is a 3-D position and 3-D velocity is num_meas = 6. Dimensions of
            covariance must be num_measÂ²

    error_model - MeasurementPositionVelocityAttitudeErrorModel:
            Defines an optional error model for other than zero-mean, additive, white Gaussian
            noise (AWGN).

    error_model_params - NumpyArray[float]:
            Error model parameters that characterize the optional error model.

    integrity - List[TypeIntegrity]:
            Measurement integrity. Includes the integrity method used and an integrity value
            (which is to be interpreted based upon the integrity method). The intent of allowing
            num_integrity > 1 is to report multiple integrity values based on multiple integrity
            methods.
