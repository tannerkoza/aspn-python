class MeasurementDeltaPosition(AspnBase):

    Delta position is the change in position from the position at time (time_of_validity - delta_t)
    to the position at time (time_of_validity), where the change in position is reported along each axis
    of the reference frame. The reference frame is chosen by the user in the reference enum.

    ### Attributes

    header - TypeHeader:
            Standard ASPN measurement header.

    time_of_validity - TypeTimestamp:
            Time at which the measurement is considered to be valid at the end of the
            delta-position period.

    reference_frame - MeasurementDeltaPositionReferenceFrame:
            Specifies measurement reference frame.

    delta_t - float:
            Duration of the observation time interval. The time_of_validity denotes the end of
            the time interval. The start of the time interval is time_of_validity - delta_t.

    term1 - Optional[Optional[float]]:
            Delta position over the first dimension specified by the enum.

    term2 - Optional[Optional[float]]:
            Delta position over the second dimension specified by the enum.

    term3 - Optional[Optional[float]]:
            Delta position over the third dimension specified by the enum.

    covariance - NumpyMatrix[float]:
            Variance or covariance matrix depending on measurement dimension. Dimensions of
            covariance must be num_measÂ²

    error_model - MeasurementDeltaPositionErrorModel:
            Defines an optional error model for other than zero-mean, additive, white Gaussian
            noise (AWGN).

    error_model_params - NumpyArray[float]:
            Error model parameters that characterize the optional error model.

    integrity - List[TypeIntegrity]:
            Measurement integrity. Includes the integrity method used and an integrity value
            (which is to be interpreted based upon the integrity method). The intent of allowing
            num_integrity > 1 is to report multiple integrity values based on multiple integrity
            methods.
